 ## STARTING THE APPLICATION

**1. To start the server and connect to the database run the command `node index.js` in the terminal.**

**2. Your API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`**

**3. You can access the candidate status for a user by making a GET request to 
http://localhost:3000/status/{USERID}, replacing {USERID} with the actual user ID you want to query.**
